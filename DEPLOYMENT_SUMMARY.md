# Render Deployment - Summary of Changes

This document summarizes all the changes made to prepare the Route Analysis Dashboard for Render deployment.

## 📦 New Files Created

### 1. `render.yaml`
**Location:** `/Users/h0r03cw/Desktop/Coding/Quick Analysis/render.yaml`

**Purpose:** Render configuration file that tells Render how to build and deploy the app.

**Key Settings:**
- Runtime: Node.js
- Region: Oregon (configurable)
- Plan: Free tier
- Auto-deploy: Enabled
- Health check: `/health` endpoint
- Disk storage: 1GB for uploads

### 2. `requirements.txt`
**Location:** `/Users/h0r03cw/Desktop/Coding/Quick Analysis/requirements.txt`

**Purpose:** Lists Python dependencies that Render will install.

**Dependencies:**
- pandas >= 2.0.0
- numpy >= 1.24.0

### 3. `RENDER_DEPLOYMENT.md`
**Location:** `/Users/h0r03cw/Desktop/Coding/Quick Analysis/RENDER_DEPLOYMENT.md`

**Purpose:** Complete step-by-step guide for deploying to Render.

**Includes:**
- Prerequisites
- Deployment steps
- Configuration settings
- Troubleshooting
- Common issues & solutions
- Monitoring instructions
- Security considerations

## 🔧 Modified Files

### 1. `my-new-project/package.json`
**Changes:**
```diff
"scripts": {
-   "start": "tsx src/cli.ts",
+   "start": "node dist/ui-server.js",
+   "dev": "tsx src/ui-server.ts",
    "ui": "tsx src/ui-server.ts",
```

**Why:**
- Production start command now runs compiled JavaScript from `dist/`
- Added `dev` script for local development with TypeScript

### 2. `my-new-project/src/ui-server.ts`
**Changes:**

**a) Dynamic PORT configuration:**
```diff
- const PORT = 3000;
+ const PORT = process.env.PORT ? parseInt(process.env.PORT) : 3000;
```

**Why:** Render uses port 10000 in production; this allows flexibility.

**b) Added Health Check Endpoint:**
```typescript
// Health check endpoint for Render
app.get('/health', (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).json({
    status: 'healthy',
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    service: 'route-analysis-dashboard'
  });
});
```

**Why:** Render uses this endpoint to verify the app is running correctly.

### 3. `.gitignore`
**Changes:**
```diff
# Build output
- dist/
+ # Build output (Note: dist/ should be committed for Render deployment)
+ # dist/  # Uncomment for local development only
*.tsbuildinfo
```

**Why:** Render needs the compiled `dist/` folder to run the app in production. By commenting it out, we allow `dist/` to be committed to Git.

### 4. `README.md`
**Changes:**
Added a new section at the top explaining two deployment options:

```markdown
## 🌐 Two Ways to Use This Tool

### Option 1: Web Deployment (Recommended for Teams)
### Option 2: Local Installation (For Development)
```

**Why:** Makes it clear that users can choose between web deployment (easier for teams) or local installation (better for development).

## 🚀 How Render Deployment Works

### Build Process
When you push to GitHub, Render automatically:

1. **Pulls the code** from your GitHub repository
2. **Installs Node.js dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd my-new-project && npm install
   ```
3. **Compiles TypeScript to JavaScript:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
4. **Installs Python dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. **Starts the application:**
   ```bash
   cd my-new-project && node dist/ui-server.js
   ```

### Runtime Environment
- **Node.js:** Latest LTS version
- **Python:** 3.11
- **Port:** 10000 (Render's default)
- **File Storage:** 1GB persistent disk for uploads

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### What's Protected:
✅ CSV data files (excluded from Git via `.gitignore`)
✅ Email template (excluded from Git)
✅ Environment variables (not committed)
✅ Generated reports (not committed)
✅ Uploaded files (temporary, cleared on restart)

### What's Public:
- Source code (on GitHub)
- Web interface (accessible to anyone with the URL)

### Recommendations:
1. **Add authentication** if handling sensitive data
2. **Use environment variables** for any API keys or secrets
3. **Monitor access logs** in Render dashboard
4. **Set up alerts** for unusual activity

---

## 📊 Environment Variables

The following environment variables are set in Render:

| Variable | Value | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------|
| `NODE_ENV` | `production` | Tells Node.js this is production |
| `PORT` | `10000` | Port Render uses for the app |
| `PYTHON_VERSION` | `3.11.9` | Specifies Python version |

---

## 🧪 Testing Before Deployment

Before deploying to Render, test locally:

```bash
# Navigate to project
cd "/Users/h0r03cw/Desktop/Coding/Quick Analysis/my-new-project"

# Build the TypeScript
npm run build

# Test production build
NODE_ENV=production PORT=10000 node dist/ui-server.js

# Open browser to http://localhost:10000
# Upload a CSV and run an analysis
```

If it works locally, it should work on Render.

---

## 🔄 Deployment Workflow

### Initial Deployment:
1. Push code to GitHub
2. Connect GitHub repo to Render
3. Configure build/start commands
4. Set environment variables
5. Deploy

### Future Updates:
1. Make changes locally
2. Test locally
3. Commit and push to GitHub
4. Render auto-deploys (3-5 minutes)

---

## 📈 Monitoring & Logs

### View Logs in Render:
1. Go to Render Dashboard
2. Click on your service
3. Click "Logs" tab
4. See real-time logs

### What to Look For:
✅ `Server running at: http://...` - App started successfully
✅ `Cleaning data before analysis...` - Data cleaning working
✅ `Running X analysis...` - Analysis executing
❌ `Error:` - Something went wrong
❌ `ENOENT:` - File not found
❌ `ModuleNotFoundError:` - Python dependency missing

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting Quick Reference

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| Build fails | Missing dependencies | Check `package.json` and `requirements.txt` |
| App crashes on start | Wrong start command | Verify: `cd my-new-project && node dist/ui-server.js` |
| 404 errors | Wrong root directory | Ensure root directory is blank in Render settings |
| Slow first load | Free tier spin-down | Normal behavior; upgrade to Starter for always-on |
| `/health` returns 404 | Old deployment | Redeploy with updated `ui-server.ts` |
| Python errors | Wrong Python version | Set `PYTHON_VERSION=3.11.9` env var |
