## Goal & Why
Build a quick analysis tool to validate Dedicated Van Delivery route performance against planned targets and identify operational outliers (extended breaks, inefficiencies).

## Context
### Pattern References
- No examples yet

### Relevant Files
- tests/

## Implementation Blueprint
[AI will generate steps based on patterns]

## Validation Loop
Task is ONLY complete when ALL pass:
```bash
npm run validate
```

## Self-Correction Protocol
If validation fails:
1) Read error output
2) Analyze failure: `{error_message}`
3) Apply minimal fix
4) Re-run: npm run validate
5) Repeat until success

## Success Criteria
- ✅ All validation gates pass
- ✅ Follows examples/ patterns
- ✅ Test coverage meets threshold
