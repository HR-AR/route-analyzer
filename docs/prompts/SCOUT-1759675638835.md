# Feature: route-analysis-dashboard
Generated: 2025-10-05

## Goal & Why
Build a quick analysis tool to validate Dedicated Van Delivery route performance against planned targets and identify operational outliers (extended breaks, inefficiencies).

## Context
### Pattern References
- No examples yet

### Relevant Files
- tests/

## Implementation Blueprint
[AI will generate steps based on patterns]

## Validation Loop
Task is ONLY complete when ALL pass:
```bash
npm run validate
```

## Self-Correction Protocol
If validation fails:
1) Read error output
2) Analyze failure: `{error_message}`
3) Apply minimal fix
4) Re-run: npm run validate
5) Repeat until success

## Success Criteria
- ✅ All validation gates pass
- ✅ Follows examples/ patterns
- ✅ Test coverage meets threshold

# Project Context

## Core Principles (Effective Context Engineering)
1. **Validation-Driven**: Done = validation passes
2. **Self-Correcting**: On failure, analyze → fix → revalidate
3. **Precedent over Instruction**: Examples define standards
4. **Dynamic Context**: Context auto-updates from codebase

## Tech Stack
- Node.js 20.x
- TypeScript 5.x
- Python 3.11+ (data analysis)
- pandas, numpy (data processing)
- PostgreSQL 15 + Prisma (future state)
- Jest for testing

## Validation Gates (must ALL pass)
```bash
npm run lint
npm run test
npm run build
```

## Self-Correction Protocol
1. Capture full error output
2. Analyze root cause
3. Apply minimal, standards-aligned fix
4. Re-run validation
5. Repeat until success

## Current Focus

**Dedicated Van Delivery Route Analysis**

Tasks:
1) Find 3–5 PUBLIC examples (prefer MIT/Apache licenses).
2) For each, provide:
   - PATTERN (name)
   - USE WHEN (scenarios)
   - KEY CONCEPTS (bullets)
   - Minimal, sanitized stub code (safe placeholders, compilable) for examples/[category]/.
   - VALIDATION: how to test it (unit/integration)
   - Self-correction hints (common failure → quick fix)
3) Include a single `Source: <URL>` line. Do NOT paste large proprietary code.

Deliver Markdown sections I can paste directly into files.
