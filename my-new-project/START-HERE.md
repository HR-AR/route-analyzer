## For Non-Technical Users (Start Here!)

### Step 1: One-Time Setup
Double-click the `setup.sh` file to install everything automatically.

Or open Terminal and run:
```bash
./setup.sh
```

This takes 2-3 minutes and only needs to be done once.

### Step 2: Start the Web Interface
Open Terminal and run:
```bash
npm run ui
```

Then open your web browser and go to: **http://localhost:3000**

### Step 3: Analyze Your Data
1. **Upload** your CSV file (the data export from your system)
2. **Select** the type of analysis you want (see below)
3. **Click** "Run Analysis"
4. **View** results in your browser
5. **Download** the report to share with your team

### Which Analysis Should I Run?

**First Time?** Start with **Store Metrics** - it gives you an overview of all stores.

- **Store Metrics** â†’ See all stores at once, find problem areas
- **Time Breakdown** â†’ Find drivers taking too long on breaks or loading
- **Returns Breakdown** â†’ Understand why orders are being returned
- **Driver Store Analysis** â†’ See which drivers at a store need coaching
- **Store Analysis** â†’ See how one store performed day-by-day
- **Multi-Day Analysis** â†’ Understand routes that span multiple days

### Stopping the Server
Press `Ctrl+C` in the Terminal window where the server is running.
